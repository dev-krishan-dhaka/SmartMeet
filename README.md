## SmartMeet 🎓

SmartMeet is an online meeting platform designed specifically for schools and colleges, similar to Google Meet or Zoom but with extra features for student attendance management.

With SmartMeet, teachers can focus on teaching while the system automatically tracks student attendance based on participation time.

## 🚀 Features

📅 Create Meetings – Teachers can create meetings with a set duration.

⏳ Attendance Timer – Host sets a minimum presence time (e.g., 15 minutes).

✅ Auto Attendance – Students are automatically marked present if they stay for the required duration.

📊 Attendance Reports – No need for manual tracking; attendance is logged automatically.

👩‍🏫 Scalable – Supports 300–400+ students in a single class.

🔒 Secure & Reliable – Safe login and meeting management system.

## 🖼️ Use Case

A teacher starts a 1-hour class and sets the attendance timer to 15 minutes.

Students must stay in the meeting for at least 15 minutes.

If a student leaves early, their attendance is not marked.

At the end of the session, the teacher gets a ready attendance record automatically.
